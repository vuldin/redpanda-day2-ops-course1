This is the Github repo for the Redpanda day 2 operations masterclass, hosted on [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/vuldin).

There are 3 scenarios focused on the following tasks:

1. commissioning brokers
2. upgrading your cluster
3. monitoring and managing alerts with Prometheus and Grafana

You will come away from this session knowing how to:

- Use RPK to verify cluster status and health
- Deploy Grafana charts to view Redpanda metrics
- Configure alerting
- Run a script that generates Grafana and Prometheus alerts
- Add and remove brokers
- Update the cluster to a new version of Redpanda

We will answer your questions throughout this interactive session.
