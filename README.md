# Day 2 Operations with Redpanda

Join us for an intensive 3-hour masterclass on how to manage and maintain your Redpanda clusters. Our Solutions Architects will drill down into details on how to operate our powerful streaming data engine.

This will be a hands-on learning environment. You will have access to a Redpanda cluster running in Kubernetes with a client generating data in a topic. You can join breakout sessions for individual help.

You will come away from this session knowing how to:

    Use RPK to verify cluster status and health
    Deploy Grafana charts to view Redpanda metrics
    Run a script that generates Grafana and Prometheus alerts
    Configure alerting
    Decommission and remove a broker
    Add a new broker with an updated version of Redpanda

We will answer your questions throughout this interactive session.
