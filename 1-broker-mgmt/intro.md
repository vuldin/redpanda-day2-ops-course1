Redpanda is a Kafka-compatible streaming data platform that is less complex and less costly than any other commercial mission-critical event streaming platform. It's fast, it's easy, and it keeps your data safe.

Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps you to manage Redpanda cluster deployments. It provides a standardized way of achieving high availability, disaster recovery, and scalability.
